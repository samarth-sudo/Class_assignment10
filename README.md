"""
    Analyze all files and save a single plot with time series, frequency spectrum, and spectrogram.
    Each file is displayed in a separate row for comparison.
    
    Analysis Findings:
    ------------------
    1. `t1.npy`, `t2.npy`, and `t4.npy`:
       - Flat frequency spectra and uniform spectrograms suggest these files are pure noise.
    2. `t3.npy`:
       - Structured frequency peaks and visible bands in the spectrogram suggest the presence of a signal.
       - This file may contain encoded information or patterns requiring further analysis.
    
    Feasibility of 1954 Recording:
    ------------------------------
    - While 1954 technology (radio telescopes) could capture such signals, the `.npy` format is modern,
      indicating these files were likely processed or converted after their initial recording.
    
    Potential Evidence of Extraterrestrial Origin:
    ---------------------------------------------
    - The structured nature of the signal in `t3.npy` suggests artificial origin, warranting further study.
    - However, no explicit evidence directly ties the signal to Alpha Centauri or intelligent life.
